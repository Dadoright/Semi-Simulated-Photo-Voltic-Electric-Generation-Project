## Project Overview

PV system is a renewable energy system which converts solar power into electricity using photovoltaic cells.
Usage of PV systems in the modern constructions are seen because it provides a greener,
sustainable and low maintenance system to the building.
PV converts solar energy into DC electricity,
then that generated energy should be converted into AC electricity using an inverter.
Photovoltaic systems generally consist of six individual components: the solar PV array,
a charge controller, a battery bank, an inverter, a utility meter, and an electric grid.
The correct installation of all of these components determines how efficient the solar panels are.
Even though solar PV arrays produce power when they are exposed to sunlight,
the other components are required for properly converting, distributing, and storing the energy that has been produced by the solar panels.
The most typical PV panel system is the grid-connected system, which as its name indicates, is connected to the national grid.
This means that at night, when the solar panels do not work, you can use electricity from the grid. 
This project will go through the high-level implementation of a PV system 
which is controlled and managed using a SCADA system along with a prototype design of the proposed system.
